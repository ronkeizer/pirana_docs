\title{Box-and-whisker plot of weighted residuals vs the independent 
  variable for Xpose 4}
\description{
  This creates a box and whisker plot of weighted residuals (WRES) vs the
  independent variable (IDV), and is a specific function in Xpose 4. 
  It is a wrapper encapsulating arguments to the \code{xpose.plot.bw} 
  function. Most of the options take their default values from xpose.data 
  object but may be overridden by supplying them as arguments.
}
\usage{
wres.vs.idv.bw(object,
           ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An xpose.data object. }
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to \code{link[xpose4generic]{xpose.plot.bw}}.}

  A wide array of extra options controlling bwplots are 
  available. See \code{\link[xpose4generic]{xpose.plot.bw}} and 
  \code{\link[xpose4generic]{xpose.panel.bw}} for details.
}
\value{
  Returns a stack of box-and-whisker plots of WRES vs IDV.
