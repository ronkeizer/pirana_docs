\title{Autocorrelation of conditional weighted residuals for Xpose 4}
\description{
  This is an autocorrelation plot of conditional weighted residuals, a specific function 
  in Xpose 4. Most of the options take their default values from xpose.data 
  object but may be overridden by supplying them as arguments.
}
\usage{
autocorr.cwres(object,
           type="p",
           smooth=TRUE,
           ids=F,
           ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An xpose.data object. }
  \item{smooth}{Logical value indicating whether a smooth should be superimposed.}
  \item{type}{1-character string giving the type of plot desired. The
    following values are possible, for details, see \code{\link{plot}}: '"p"'
    for points, '"l"' for lines, '"o"' for overplotted points and
    lines, '"b"', '"c"') for (empty if '"c"') points joined by
    lines, '"s"' and '"S"' for stair steps and '"h"' for
    histogram-like vertical lines.  Finally, '"n"' does not
    produce any points or lines. }
  \item{ids}{A logical value indicating whether text labels should be
    used as plotting symbols (the variable used for these symbols
    indicated by the \code{idlab} xpose data variable).}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to \code{link[xpose4generic]{xpose.plot.default}}.}
}
\details{
  A wide array of extra options controlling xyplots are 
  available. See \code{\link[xpose4generic]{xpose.plot.default}} for
  details.
      
  Conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) require some extra steps to
  calculate. See \code{\link[xpose4generic]{compute.cwres}} for details.
}
\value{
  Returns an aotocorrelation plot for conditional weighted population residuals (CWRES).
