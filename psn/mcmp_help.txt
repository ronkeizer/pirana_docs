    Monte-Carlo Mapped Power





    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -critical_ofv=number

      Critical ofv for the chi-square test. No default. If this option is set,
      then options -df and -significance_level will be ignored.

      -curve

      Default set. Can be disabled with -no-curve. This option controls whether
      the complete power curve up to the target power should be generated, 
      or if the program should only compute the sample size required to achieve 
      the target power.

      -df=number

      Number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test.
      Default 1.

      -full_model=file

      The full model.

      -increment=number

      The step-size for the total sample size. Default is the number of strata 
      (1 if stratification is not used).

      -max_size=number

      The largest total sample size to test. Default is the size of the dataset.

      -n_bootstrap=number

      Number of bootstrap samples for each total sample size.
      Default 10000.

      -reduced_model=file

      The reduced model.

      -significance_level=number

      Significance level for the chi-square test.
      Default 5 (%). Permitted values are 5, 1 and 0.1.

      -simdata=file

      Optional. If given then no simulation will be performed, instead this
      datafile will be used when estimating the full and reduced model.

      -simulation_model=file

      The simulation model. Default is the full model.

      -start_size=number

      The first total sample size to test. Default is 3 times the setting of option -increment.

      -stratify_on=VARIABLE

      Variable to stratify on. The variable must be the same for all observations
      for an individual.

      -table_full=file

      Use an already created tablefile with iofv:s for the full model
      instead of letting the program run the estimation.

      -table_reduced=file

      Use an already created tablefile with iofv:s for the reduced model
      instead of letting the program run the estimation.

      -table_strata=file

      Use an already created tablefile with the stratification variable
      instead of letting the program create one during the estimation.

      -target_power=number

      The highest power for which the program will determine the
      required sample size. Default 98.
