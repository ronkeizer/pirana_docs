    bootstrap
      
      Bootstrap using the percentile or BCa method.
      
    Usage:



   Description:

      The Bootstrap can be used to calculate bias, standard errors and
      confidence intervals. It does so by resampling with replacement
      from the data, see Efron B, An Introduction to the Bootstrap,
      Chap. & Hall, London UK, 1993. To compute standard errors for
      all parameters of a model using the non-parametric bootstrap
      implemented here, roughly 200 model fits are necessary. To assess
      95% confidence intervals approximatly 2000 runs will suffice.

   Example:

      bootstrap -samples=200 run89.mod

      This will run a non-parametric bootstrap of 200 samples and give
      you good estimates of the standard errors of the parameter
      estimates. You may get some estimates for the confidence
      intervals too, but they will generally not be of high quality.


      bootstrap -samples=2000 -bca run89.mod

      This will run a non-parametric bootstrap using the BCa technique
      (See An introduction to the bootstrap, Efron, 1993). The BCa is
      intended for caclulation of second-order correct confidence
      intervals.


      bootstrap -samples=2000 -bca -stratify_on=5 run89.mod 

      This is the same BCa approach as above but with stratification
      on the factors of column five.

   Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t (or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -allow_ignore_id

      Allow IGNORE/ACCEPT statements in the $DATA record based on ID column.
      Default not used, i.e. IGNORE/ACCEPT certain ID values is not allowed. 
      Warning: If turned on, resampling of individuals
      may be erroneous, since the script renumbers individuals before sampling.

      -bca

      Using the -bca option, the bootstrap
      utility will calculate the confidence intervals through the BCa
      method. The default approach however, is not to use the BCa (see
      Efron B, An introduction to the Bootstrap, 1993). The BCa is
      intended for calculation of second-order correct confidence
      intervals.  

      -copy_data
    Default not set. By default, the bootstrapped datasets bs_pr1_.dta 
    generated in the m1 subdirectory are not copied to the NM_run subdirectories 
    of modelfit_dir1. Relative data paths, ../../m1/bs_pr1_.dta , are 
    used in $DATA in the modelfiles in NM_run. This saves much disk space. 
    If -copy_data is set, the bootstrapped datasets are instead copied to the 
    NM_run directories, and $DATA has  bs_pr1_.dta without any path.


      -rplots

      Generate R scripts for making various plots of the result.

      -sample_size

      The number of subjects in each bootstrap data set. The default
      value is set to the number of individuals in the original data
      set.

      When the resampling is stratified, the sample_size option can be
      used to specify the exact number of samples that should be drawn
      from each strata. Below follows an example of the syntax that
      should be used in such a case. Stratification is here done based
      on the study number, STUD, with the values 1001, 1002 and 1003.

      -sample_size='1001=>12,1002=>24,1003=>10'

      This example specifies that the bootstrap should use 12 samples
      from study 1001, 24 samples from 1002 and 10 from study 1003.

      If only one sample size is used together with stratified
      resampling (the default case; sample_size=number of individuals
      in the data set), the strata are assigned samples in proportion
      to their size in the data set. Please note that this usage of
      the sample_size option does not guarantee that the sum of the
      samples of the strata is equal to the given sample_size since
      PsN needs to round the figures to the closest integer. For a
      sample size equal to the number of individuals in the data set,
      the sum will however always be correct.


      -samples

      The number of bootstrap samples/datasets to generate.

      -skip_covariance_step_terminated

      With this option enabled, the bootstrap will skip all samples
      where the NONMEM run terminated the covariance step.
      Force disabling with -no-skip_covariance_step_terminated.

      -skip_estimate_near_boundary

      With this option enabled, the bootstrap will skip all samples
      where the NONMEM run signal that some estimates are near its
      boundary.
      Force disabling with -no-skip_estimate_near_boundary.

      -skip_minimization_terminated

      With this option enabled, the bootstrap will skip all samples
      where the NONMEM run terminated the minimization step.
      Force disabling with -no-skip_minimization_terminated.

      -skip_with_covstep_warnings

      With this option enabled, the bootstrap will skip all samples
      where the NONMEM run had warnings from the covariance step.
      Force disabling with -no-skip_with_covstep_warnings.

      -stratify_on=integer|string

      It may be necessary to use stratification in the resampling
      procedure. For example, if the original data consists of two
      groups of patients - say 10 patients with full pharmacokinetic
      profiles and 90 patients with sparse steady state concentration
      measurements - it may be wise to restrict the resampling
      procedure to resample within the two groups, producing bootstrap
      data sets that all contain 10 rich + 90 sparse data patients but
      with different compositions. The default is not to use
      stratification. Set -stratify_on to
      the column that defines the two groups. If a string is used with
      stratify_on the header in the datafile is used to map the string
      to a column number.

      Note that the option sample_size has a different behavior when
      stratified resampling is used.

      Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common options.
