    sumo

    Perl script for summarizing output data. 
    It gathers some useful information from NONMEM output files and prints
    a summary to screen.





 Options:

    The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
    abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. 
    
    The following options are valid:

    -c_level='integer'
    Default 95

    This option specifies the coverage of the confidence interval
    computed by the -ci option (see below). Allowed values are 90, 95,
    99 and 99.5

    -check_run
    Default set

    If this option is unset with -no-check_run the initial run diagnostic output of sumo
    will be suppressed.


    -condition_number_limit='number'
    Default 1000

    The cut-off for issuing a warning for a high condition number. The
    test will only be made if the $COV step has been requested in the
    NMtran control stream and NONMEM has been asked to report
    eigenvalues ($COV PRINT=E).


      -confidence_interval|ci

      No help available for 'confidence_interval|ci'

    -correlation_limit='number'
    Default 0.9

    The cut-off for issuing a warning for high correlations between
    the parameter estimates. This test will only be made if the $COV
    step has been requested in the NMtran control stream.


    -csv
    Default not set

    Produce output in which the columns of the parameters estimates
    and standard errors are comma separated. This option can be used
    if you wish to import the sumo output into a spreadsheet programs,
    such as MS Excel. (Something like this is probably what you would
    want to do in that case: sumo -csv run1.lst > sumooutput.csv)


    -debug='integer'
    Default 0

    This is mainly for developers who wish to debug PsN. By default
    'integer' is zero but you can try setting it to '1' and you might
    get some helpful warnings. If you run in to problems that require
    support, you might be told to crank this number up and send the
    output to us.

    -debug_package='string'
    Default not set

    Mostly for developers.

    -debug_subroutine='string'
    Default not set
    
    Only for developers.


    -help
      
    With -help sumo will print this, longer, help message.

    -h | -?
      
    With -h or -? sumo will print a list of options and exit.

    -large_omega_cv_limit='number'
    Default 0.50

    When the CV (SE/estimate) for a parameter estimates is greater
    than this a warning will be issued.


    -large_sigma_cv_limit='number'
    Default 0.30

    When the CV (SE/estimate) for a parameter estimates is greater
    than this a warning will be issued.


    -large_theta_cv_limit='number'
    Default 0.30

    When the CV (SE/estimate) for a parameter estimates is greater
    than this a warning will be issued.

    -max_problem_num='integer'
    Default 1

    PsN divides NONMEM output into problems and sub-problems. 
    The default is for sumo to report the results for the first
    $PROBLEM only.


    -max_subproblem_num='integer'
    Default 1

    PsN divides NONMEM output into problems and sub-problems. 
    The default is for sumo to report the results for the first
    subproblem only.


    -near_bound_sign_digits='integer'
    Default 2

    When a parameter estimates is equal to a boundary with these many
    significant digits, a warning will be issued. The default is for
    NONMEM VI to report if parameter estimates are close to a boundary
    value but this can be turned off. The boundary test in sumo is
    independent of the way NONMEM is configured and will report these
    types of issues in output from NONMEM.


    -near_zero_boundary_limit='number'
    Default 0.001

    If the bound is 0, the boundary test will issue a warning if the
    estimate is this close to zero.


    -precision='integer'
    Default 4

    Output precision.

    -sd_rse
    Default set

    If sd_rse is not set sumo will report the relative standard errors for the
    random effects parameters (omega and sigma) on the variance scale
    (SE/variance estimate). If sd_rse is set, sumo will report these
    on the (approximate) standard deviation scale: (SE/variance
    estimate)/2.


    -sign_digits_off_diagonals='integer' 
    Default 2

    The boundary test for off-diagonal omega elements are performed by
    first converting the covariances to the corresponding correlations
    and then check if they are close to +/-1 with this many
    significant digits.
