    Generate ranked empirical Bayes estimates






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -thr, but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -estimate_input

      Default set. By default, PsN will rerun the input model to get parameter 
      estimates unless an output file is found or option -lst_file is set. But 
      if option -estimate_input is unset with -no-estimate_input and no lst-file 
      is found then the parameter estimates set in the input model will be used
      for simulations.

      -gls_data_file=filename

      Default gls_data.dta. A file with input data for the gls program is always 
      generated. This option changes the name of that file. After this file is 
      created, the gls program can be run with option -gls_model and -ind_shrinkage 
      with minimum runtime, see gls_userguide.pdf

      -lst_file=filename

      Default not set. By default PsN will, before copying the input model to the 
      simulation models, look for an output file with final estimates for the input 
      model and if found update the initial estimates in the simulation models. If 
      option -lst_file is set Psn will instead use the final estimates in the given 
      file. If option is not set and no output file is found PsN will not update the 
      estimates but instead rerun the input model, if option -estimate_input is set.

      -reminimize

      Default not set. By default, simulated datasets will be run with MAXEVAL=0 
      (or equivalent for non-classical estimation methods). If option -reminimize 
      is set then $EST will be the same as in the input model.

      -samples=N

      Default 300. The number of simulations and reestimations to perform.

    Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common PsN options.
