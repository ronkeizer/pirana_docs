  data_stats

  Usage:

  data_stats [ -h | -? ] [ -help ]
             [ -columns='string' ]
	     [ -ignore_columns='string' ]
             [ -debug='integer' ] 
	     [ -debug_package='string' ] 
	     [ -debug_subroutine='string' ]
	     outputfile(s)

  Description:

    data_stats calculates and prints simple statistics for data
    files. Simple stastics are max, min, mean, median, range and
    standard deviation for each column.

  Examples:
    
    Calculate statistics for all columns in file.dta
    
    $ data_stats file.dta

    Calculate statistics for all columns except WGT and AGE.
    
    $ data_stats --ignore_columns=WGT,AGE

    Calculate statistics for WGT and AGE only

    $ data_stats --columns=WGT,AGE

  Options:

    The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
    abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option may
    be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
    abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
    -debug_subroutines.

    The following options are valid:

    -h | -?

    Print a list of options.


    -columns='strings'

    By default data_stats prints statistics for all columns of the
    data set. But if you give a comma separated list of column headers
    or column numbers with the -columns option, then data_stats will
    print statistics for those columns only.

    
    -ignore_columns='strings'

    ignore_columns work the oposite way of -columns, it lets you
    select column headers or column numbers for which data_stats
    should not print statistcs. It also takes a comma separated list.

    -help

    Print this, longer, help message.


    -debug='integer'

    Default value is: 0

    This is mainly for developers who whish to debug PsN. By default
    'integer' is zero but you can try setting it to '1' and you might
    get some helpfull warnings. If you run in to problems that require
    support, you might be told to crank this number up and send the
    output to us.


    -debug_package='string'

    Default value is: empty string

    If use together with '-debug' it is possible to choose which part
    of PsN you want to see debug messages from. Again this is mostly
    for developers.


    -debug_subroutine='string'
    
    Default value is: empty string

    With this option it is possible to specify, with even finer
    granularity, which part of PsN you want to see debug messages
    from. This is definitly only for developers.
