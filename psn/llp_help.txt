      Log-likelihood profiling of NONMEM runs.

    Usage:



    Description:

      The Log-likelihood Profiling tool can be used to assess
      confidence interval limits for parameter estimates. The
      -2*log-likelihood of hierarchical models are chi-square
      distributed. Fixing a parameter reduces the number of parameters
      of the model by one. To be able to say, for a given level of
      confidence, that there is a higher likelihood that the data has
      been produced by a system described by the full model than by one
      described by the reduced, the difference in the -2*log-likelihood
      should be at least X. For example, using a confidence level of
      95%, the difference (or X above) should be at least 3.84. The
      minimal number of arguments include a modelfile name and a
      listing of parameters, given that an output file with standard
      error estimates exist.

    Example:
      
      llp run89.mod -thetas='1,2'

      This will make the llp tool try to estimate the confidence
      intervals for thetas one and two of the model in run89.mod. It
      will base the first guesses on the standard error estimates from
      run89.lst.

      llp run89.mod -thetas='1,2' -rse_thetas='20,30'

      In this example, we explicitly specify the relative standard
      errors which is necessary if we do not have an output file with
      standard error estimates.

    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.
    
      The following options are valid:

      -max_iterations=integer

      This number limits the number of search iterations for each
      interval limit. If the llp has not found the upper limit for a
      parameter after max_iteration number of guesses it
      terminates. The default value is 10.

      -normq=number

      This number is used for calculating the first guess of the
      confidence interval limits. If the standard errors exist, the
      first guess will be
      
      maximum-likelihood estimate +/- normq * standard error

      otherwise it will be approximated with 

      maximum-likelihood estimate +/- normq * rse_parameter/100 * maximum-likelihood estimate

      where rse_parameter is rse_thetas, rse_omegas or rse_sigmas. The
      default value is 1.96 which translates a 95% confidence interval
      assuming normal distribution of the parameter estimates.

      -ofv_increase

      The increase in objective function value associated with the
      desired confidence interval. The default value is 3.84.

      -omegas='comma-separated list of parameter numbers'

      Specifies the parameters for which the llp should try to assess
      confidence intervals.

      -outputfile=filename

      The name of the NONMEM output file. The default value is the
      name of the model file with a '.mod' substituted with
      '.lst'. Example: if the modelfile is run89.mod, the default name
      of the output file is run89.lst. If the name of the modelfile is
      cmd123 the default name of the output file is cmd123.lst. If the
      name of your output file does not follow this standard, you have
      to specify it with this option. 

      -rse_omegas='comma-separated list of relative standard errors'

      Relative standard errors for the omegas listed with option -omegas.
      The values should be specified in percent (%).

      -rse_sigmas='comma-separated list of relative standard errors'

      Relative standard errors for the sigmas listed with option -sigmas.
      The values should be specified in percent (%).

      -rse_thetas='comma-separated list of relative standard errors'

      Relative standard errors for the thetas listed with option -thetas.
      The values should be specified in percent (%).

      -sigmas='comma-separated list of parameter numbers'

      Specifies the parameters for which the llp should try to assess
      confidence intervals.

      -significant_digits=integer

      Specifies the number of significant digits that is required for
      the test of the increase in objective function value. The
      default is three, which means that the method will stop once the
      difference in objective function value is between 3.835 and
      3.845 if -ofv_increase is set to 3.84 (default).


      -thetas='comma-separated list of parameter numbers'

      Specifies the parameters for which the llp should try to assess
      confidence intervals.

      Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common options.
