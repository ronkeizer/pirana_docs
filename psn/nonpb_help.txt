    Non-Parametric Bootstrap.

  Usage:





    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -lst_file=

      Optional, the lst-file from where to read initial parameter estimates. 
      Default is the same name as the model file but with .mod replaced with .lst.

      -nonpb_version=1|2

      Optional, the version of the script to run. Default is 1, the simplified version.
      Version 2 is the full version.

      -samples=N

      Required option. The number of samples for the bootstrap.


      Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common options.
