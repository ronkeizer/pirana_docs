    Stochastic Simulation and Estimation of NONMEM models.






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -thr, but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -add_models

      This option tells PsN to add the alternative models listed with option 
      -alternative_models to an old sse run. All models given via option
      -alternative_models will be estimated from scratch, so the alternatives from
      the old run should not be listed again. The -add_models option requires that 
      the old sse run has been completed without errors. It is necessary to also set 
      the general PsN option -directory to the sse directory of the old run, 
      e.g. -directory=sse_dir50.
      The user must ensure that the -samples option in the new sse run is 
      equal to or smaller than in the old run. If some simulated datasets are 
      missing it will result in an error. 
      The simulation model must still be given as input on the command-line.
      If the option -estimate_simulation is set (it is set by default) the 
      original model will be estimated, regardless of whether is was estimated 
      in the old run. Old estimation results will not be reloaded.
      The numbering of the extra models will start at the number of the last old
      alternative plus 1.


      -alternative_models=alt1.mod,alt2.mod,...

      List of one or more alternative models to use for estimation 
      with simulated datasets. The filenames must be comma-separated,
      no spaces.

      -estimate_simulation

      By default, the simulation model is also used for estimation with
      the simulated datasets. The resulting OFV values are used as reference
      when evaluating the estimation results of alternative models. By setting
      -no-estimate_simulation the estimation of the simulation model is turned
      off, and the first alternative model is used as reference instead. See
      also -ref_ofv.

      -in_filter=

      Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. Default not used.
      The parameter estimates lines in the file can be filtered on values 
      in the different columns. When specifying which column(s) the filtering 
      should be based on, the exact column name must be used, 
      e.g. minimization_successful. Filtering can only be based on columns 
      with numeric values. The allowed relations are .gt. (greater than), 
      .lt. (less than) and .eq. (equal to). Conditions are separated with commas. 
      If the remaining number of lines after filtering is smaller than -samples, 
      sse will stop with an error message. Then the user must either change the 
      filtering rules or change -samples. If the user has created a file with 
      parameter estimates outside of PsN, filtering can be done on any numeric 
      column in that file. Do not set column headers containing .eq. or .lt. 
      or .gt.in the user-generated file as this would interfere with the in_filter 
      option syntax.
    
      Example: -in_filter=minimization_successful.eq.1,significant_digits.gt.3.5


      -offset_rawres=N

      Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. Default 1.
      The number of result lines to skip in the input raw results file
      before starting to read final parameter estimates. In a regular
      bootstrap raw_results file the first line of estimates refers to the
      input model with the full dataset, so therefore the default offset is 1.

      -out_filter=

      Default not used. The user may choose to only compute results based on 
      estimations which fulfill certain conditions. The default is to only skip 
      runs where the ofv cannot be read from the lst-file or is equal to 0. 
      Filtering of output can be done on any numeric column in a standard sse 
      raw_results file, for example minimization_successful, significant_digits 
      and covariance_step_successful. The allowed relations are .gt. (greater than), 
      .lt. (less than) and .eq. (equal to). Conditions are separated with commas. 
      If the remaining number of estimation results after filtering is less than 2, 
      sse will stop with an error message.
    
      Example: -out_filter=minimization_successful.eq.1,significant_digits.gt.3.5


      -parallel_simulations=1

      parallel_simulations govern the number of simulations that will
      be done in parallel. Normally simulations are quite fast and
      need only be run one at a time. See the threads option for
      control over the number of estimations to do in parallel.

      -rawres_input=filename

      A simple way to simulate with uncertainty.
      Instead of using identical parameter estimates for simulation of each
      new dataset, take parameter estimates from a raw_results.csv file,
      e.g. from a bootstrap run. The raw results file must contain
      at least as many samples as the input -samples to sse plus the 
      value of option -offset_rawres, the labels
      for THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA in the file must match the labels in the
      simulation model given as input to sse, the theta columns must be directly followed
      by the omega columns which must be directly followed by the sigma columns,
      and the first column must have header model as a bootstrap raw_results file.

      -recompute=

      Default not set. Setting this option makes PsN recompute output statistics based on 
      the specified raw_results file. Note that the filename must be given including the 
      directory name. The user may change the -out_filter settings for the recomputation. 
      Apart from -out_filter, the input model must be set, and -samples. 
      Alternative models are not needed, information about them will be read from the raw results file.
      Option -directory will be ignored, instead the directory specified as part of the file 
      path will be used.

      Example: -recompute=sse_dir12/raw_results_run1.csv

      -ref_ofv=500

      Instead of using the OFV values from the estimation of a model as
      reference when evaluating the other estimation results,
      it is possible to set a fixed reference OFV value. If using ref_ofv,
      it is not allowed to also estimate the simulation model. 

      -samples=N

      The number of simulated datasets to generate.

    Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common PsN options.
