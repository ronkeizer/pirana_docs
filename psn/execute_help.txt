  execute

    Running one or more modelfiles using PsN.




  Description:

    The execute utility is a Perl script that allows you to run multiple
    modelfiles either sequentially or in parallel. It is an nmfe replacement
    with advanced extra functionality.
    
    The execute program creates subdirectories where it puts NONMEMs
    input and output files, to make sure that parallel NONMEM runs do not
    interfere with each other. The top directory is by default named
    'modelfit_dirX' where 'X' is a number that starts at 1 and is
    increased by one each time you run the execute utility.
    
    When the NONMEM runs are finished, the output and table files will be
    copied to the directory where execute started in which means that you
    can normaly ignore the 'modelfit_dirX' directory. If you need to
    access any special files you can find them inside the
    'modelfit_dirX'. Inside the 'modelfit_dirX' you find a few
    subdirectories named 'NM_runY'. For each model file you
    specified on the command line there will be one 'NM_runY' directory in
    which the actual NONMEM execution takes place. The order of the
    'NM_runY' directories corresponds to the order of the modelfiles given
    on the command line. The first run will take place inside 'NM_run1',
    the second in 'NM_run2' and so on.

  Example:

    $ execute pheno.mod 

    Runs one model file and accepts all default values.

    $ execute -threads=2  -retries=5 phenobarbital.mod pheno_alternate.mod

    Runs two model files in parallel using 5 possible retries.p

  Options:

    The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
    abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option may
    be abbreviated to -t (or even -thr) but -debug may not be
    abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
    -debug_subroutines.
    
    The following options are valid:

    -abort_on_fail
    If the -abort_on_fail option is set and one of the NONMEM runs
    fails, PsN will stop scheduling more runs and try to stop
    those that are currently running. A run is considered failed if it
    fails to produce a list file which PsN can read. This can occur
    if a nonmem run crashes or gets killed.

    -accepted_ofv_difference='number'
    Default 0.1. This option is used by PsN only when selecting the best retry 
    out of the whole set, provided that -picky was not used or no try fulfilled
    the picky conditions. The selection will be based on the 'corrected ofv'. 
    For tries that did not have minimization successful the corrected ofv is 
    equal to the ofv. For tries that had minimization successful the corrected 
    ofv is the ofv minus 'accepted_ofv_difference'. This means that this option 
    decides how much preference should be given to runs that have minimization 
    successful.

    -adaptive
    -adaptive enables a highly experimental feature to dynamically 
    assign the number of threads depending on the number of running
    nonmem processes on the computer. It requires a server program
    which is not distributed with PsN. If you are interrested in this
    feature, contact the PsN developers.

    -add_retries

    By default, PsN will never do retries on a model when a run is restarted if
    the file stats-runs.csv is found in the NM_run subdirectory, since the
    existence of this file indicates that all retries have finished and the
    best try has been selected. If option -add_retries is set, PsN will ignore 
    that stats-runs.csv exists, and check again if retries are needed based on 
    the existing tries in the NM_run directory. This makes it possible to restart
    a run using different settings for retries (e.g. -retries, -min_retries, -picky).

    -clean='integer 0-3'
    The -clean clean option can take four different values:
    0 - means that nothing is removed, 
    1 - NONMEM binary and intermediate files except INTER are removed, and files specified with 
    option -extra_files (this is the default), 
    2 - model and output files generated by PsN restarts are removed, and data files 
    in the NM_run directory,
    3 - the whole NM_run directory is removed 
    and if it is not an "execute" command, all modelfit_dir:s will be removed.

    -compress
    PsN will compress the contents of 'NM_runX' to the
    file 'nonmem_files.tgz' if the -compress option is used and if you
    have the archive and compress programs tar and gzip installed. If
    you use the -clean options, run files will be
    removed before the compression. The -compress option obviously has
    no effect if you also use the -clean option.

    -condition_number_limit='number'
    An error will be raised in the output from sumo
    if the condition number is greater than this number. 

    -correlation_limit='number'
    All correlations above this number will be listed in the output from sumo.

    -crash_restarts='integer'
    If a NONMEM outputfile is produced but PsN is unable to read it
    properly it is assumed that NONMEM crashed, probably due to
    something in the operating system, and PsN will start the run
    again. But PsN will not consider it a retry and will not change
    initial estimates. The default value is 4.

    -cwres
    Compute the conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) for a model run. 
    Option is only supported for NONMEM5 and NONMEM6. In NONMEM7, CWRES can
    be requested directly from $TABLE.

      -d2u

      No help available for 'd2u'

    -debug='integer'
    The -debug option is mainly intended for developers who wish to
    debug PsN. By default -debug is set to zero but you can try
    setting it to '1' to enable warning messages. If you run into
    problems that require support, you may have to increase this
    number to 2 or 3 and send the output to the developers.

    -debug_package='string'
    When used together with -debug, the -debug_package option makes it
    possible to choose which part of PsN you want to see debug
    messages for. Again, this option is mostly for developers.

    -debug_subroutine='string'
    Default value is: empty string
    With this option it is possible to specify, with even finer
    granularity, which part of PsN you want to see debug messages
    from. This is definetly only for developers.

    -directory='string'
    The directory option sets the directory in which PsN will run
    NONMEM. The default directory name is 'modelfit_dirX' for execute,
    where X will be increased by one each time you run the script.
    For other scripts/tools, the default is 'toolname_dirX', for 
    example bootstrap_dir1. You do not have to create the directory, 
    it will be done for you.

    If you abort the run or if your system crashes you can use the
    '-directory' option set to the directory of the run that
    crashed. PsN will then not run the modelfiles that had
    finished before the crash, thereby saving some time. Notice that
    is important that you give exactly the same options that you gave
    the first time (exception npc and vpc tools, see npc manual).

    -display_iterations
    This option turns on display the iterations output from NONMEM during
    the model run. The option can be disabled with -no-display_iterations.

    -drop_dropped
    If there are drop columns in your control file and -drop_dropped 
    is used, PsN will remove those columns from the data set used
    internally. It saves both diskspace and conserves memory
    usage. Note that PsN does NOT alter your original data set, only
    those used internally in PsN.

    -email_address='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_slurm and -send_email in combination, otherwise ignored.
    The email address in sbatch options --mail_type=ALL --mail_user=.

    -extra_data_files='extra_data1.dta, COLUMN1, COLUMN2'
    NONMEM only allows 20 column datasets, but PsN can add code to
    control files that reads extra data columns from a separate
    file. To use this feature you must divide the original file into two
    using the script single_valued_columns (distributed together with PsN).
    Provided that each of the two new files contain at most 20 columns, you
    write the name of the file with multiple valued columns as the data file 
    in the NONMEM modelfile. On the command line you then
    specify a comma separated list with -extra_data_files. 
    The first element in the list is the name of the file with single valued columns,
    and the rest of the list is the column headers of the extra data file.
    If any of the two new files generated by single_valued_columns contains 
    more than 20 columns, this feature cannot be used.

    -extra_files='extra_file1.dta, extra_file2.dta'
    If you need extra files in the directory where NONMEM is run you
    specify them in the comma separated -extra_files list. It could for 
    example be fortran subroutines you need compiled with NONMEM.

    -extra_output='file1,file2'
    If NONMEM generates a file which PsN normally does not copy back
    to the working directory, specifying a comma-separated list
    of such files with this options will make PsN copy the listed files.
    An example is output generated by verbatim code.

    -handle_crashes
    PsN tries to recognize NONMEM runs that crashed for various reasons,
    e.g. a computer crash or a NONMEM run deliberaterly killed, and restart
    those runs without changing initial parameter estimates.

    -handle_msfo
    Experimental feature for handling resumes using msfo and msfi files.

    -help
    With -help a longer help message will be printed.

    -html_help
    Generate help text suitable for PsN homepage.

    -h | -?

    With -h or -? the script prints the list of available options 
    and exit.

    -iofv
    Compute the individual contributions to the objective function.
    Option is only supported for NONMEM5 and NONMEM6. In NONMEM7, individual ofv
    values can be found in the addtional output phi file.

    -large_omega_cv_limit='number'
    Coefficients of variation larger than this number will produce
    warnings in the output from sumo.

    -large_sigma_cv_limit='number'
    Coefficients of variation larger than this number will produce
    warnings in the output from sumo.

    -large_theta_cv_limit='number'
    Coefficients of variation larger than this number will produce
    warnings in the output from sumo.

    -last_est_complete
      
      Only applies if NONMEM7 and multiple $ESTIMATION records. Then only for scripts
      vpc (any options), cdd (if option -xv) and execute (if option -mirror_plots 
      and/or nonparametric_etas). Setting this option tells PsN that all 
      options needed for the last estimation step, such as LIKELIHOOD 
      (defaults can be omitted), are set explicitly in the 
      last $ESTIMATION record, i.e. no options need to carry over from previous $EST.
      Then PsN will skip the step where all $ESTIMATION records are searched for
      relevant options before removing all but the last $ESTIMATION and setting
      MAXEVAL=0 or EONLY=1. More details in the userguide.

    -last_est_complete
      
      Only applies if NONMEM7 and multiple $ESTIMATION records. Then only for scripts
      vpc (any options), cdd (if option -xv) and execute (if option -mirror_plots 
      and/or nonparametric_etas). Setting this option tells PsN that all 
      options needed for the last estimation step, such as LIKELIHOOD 
      (defaults can be omitted), are set explicitly in the 
      last $ESTIMATION record, i.e. no options need to carry over from previous $EST.
      Then PsN will skip the step where all $ESTIMATION records are searched for
      relevant options before removing all but the last $ESTIMATION and setting
      MAXEVAL=0 or EONLY=1. More details in the userguide.

    -lsf_job_name='string'
    lsf_job_name sets the name of the LSF job name of every NONMEM run, 
    they all get the same name.

    -lsf_options='string'
    LSF jobs are submitted using bsub and all LSF related options are
    translated to corresponding bsub options. For maximum flexibility
    we allow any string to be passed as options to bsub, so if a specific 
    bsub feature not available through any ot the other -lsf_ options 
    is needed, use lsf_options to pass any option to bsub.

    -lsf_project_name='string'
    Use lsf_project_name to assign a
    project name to your LSF runs.

    -lsf_queue='string'
    lsf_queue specifies which LSF queue PsN should submit NONMEM runs 
    to and is used in conjuction with -run_on_lsf

    -lsf_resources='string'
    lsf_resources specifies which LSF resources is required when submiting
    NONMEM runs.

    -lsf_sleep='string'
    Pause for this many seconds after bsub submission, before continuing running PsN.

    -lsf_ttl='string'
    lsf_ttl sets the maximum time a NONMEM run should be allowed to run on 
    the LSF grid.

    -max_runtime='integer'
    A limit on how long a slurm run may go on before being aborted
    (option -t to sbatch). Format is either minutes, e.g. -max_runtime=10, 
    or hours:minutes:seconds, e.g. -max_runtime=4:0:0, or days-hours, 
    e.g. -max_runtime=3-0

    -maxevals=100000
    NONMEM only allows 9999 function evaluations. PsN can expand this
    limit by adding an MSFO option to $ESTIMATION. Later when NONMEM
    hits the max number of function evaluations allowed by NONMEM (9999) 
    PsN will remove intial estimates from the modelfile and add $MSFI 
    and restart NONMEM. This will be repeated until the number of function
    evaluations specified with option maxevals has been reached.

    -min_retries='integer'
    min_retries forces PsN to try
    several initial values for each estimate and selecting the best
    one. The best model is the one with highest number of significant 
    digits and an ofv value no more than five units above than the 
    lowest ofv value among all models. If -picky
    is used, only models which first pass the picky test will be considered.

    -mirror_from_lst
    Can only be used in combination with -mirror_plots=XX where XX is an 
    integer representing the number of simulations to perform. These commands 
    create a set of simulations from a model file and output file that can 
    then be read into Xpose 4 for mirror plotting.  The -mirror_from_lst option
    reads from the *.lst file of a NONMEM run to get final parameter estimates 
    for the simulations. 

    -mirror_plots='integer'
    This command creates a set of simulations from a model file that can then 
    be read into Xpose 4 for mirror plotting. The command requires an integer 
    value -mirror_plots=XX where XX is an integer representing the number of
    simulations to perform. This command uses the MSFO file created by
    runN.mod to get final estimates used in the simulations. If this file is
    not available run1.mod is run again.  If run times are long, and you did
    not create an MSFO file with your initial NONMEM run, you can combine the
    above command with the -mirror_from_lst option to avoid running the model
    again (PsN then reads from the *.lst file to get final parameter estimates
    for the simulations).

    -missing_data_token='string'
    missing_data_token sets the string
    that PsN accepts as missing data, default is -99.

    -model_dir_name
    model_dir_name specifies that execute
    should automatically create a name for the directory in which
    NONMEM will be run. The name is based on the first model file
    specified on the command line and will be modelfilename.dir.X,
    where X will be incremented for each time modelfile is
    execute(d). If the option -directory is used it will override
    -model_dir_name.

    -near_bound_sign_digits='integer'
    If a parameter estimate is equal to a bound with this many
    significant digits, a warning will be printed. Valid only with sumo.

    -near_zero_boundary_limit='number'
    When the bound is zero, the check using -near_bound_sign_digits is not valid. 
    Use this limit instead. Valid only with sumo.

    -nice='integer'
    This option only has effect on unix like operating systems. It
    sets the priority (or nice value) on a process. You can give any
    value that is legal for the "nice" command, likely it is between 0
    and 19, where 0 is the highest priority. Check "man nice" for
    details.

    -niter_eonly
      
      Only applies if NONMEM7 and last $EST is IMP or IMPMAP. Only for scripts
      vpc (any options), cdd (if option -xv) and execute (if option -mirror_plots 
      and/or nonparametric_etas). Undefined by default.
      User-chosen value of NITER in IMP or IMPMAP when estimation is turned off
      by setting EONLY=1. See PsN_and_NONMEM7.pdf for details.

    -niter_eonly
      
      Only applies if NONMEM7 and last $EST is IMP or IMPMAP. Only for scripts
      vpc (any options), cdd (if option -xv) and execute (if option -mirror_plots 
      and/or nonparametric_etas). Undefined by default.
      User-chosen value of NITER in IMP or IMPMAP when estimation is turned off
      by setting EONLY=1. See PsN_and_NONMEM7.pdf for details.

    -nm_output='comma-separated list of file extensions'

    NONMEM generates many output files per run. NM7.2 can, in addition to the
    lst-file, generate 11 files. The lst-file will always be copied back to the
    calling directory. The option -nm_output decides which of the 11 additional 
    files should also be copied back to the calling directory. The default is none. 
    NM output files which are not copied to the calling directory can still be 
    found inside the run directory.

  Example: -nm_output=ext,cov


    -nm_version='string'
    If you have more than one installation of NONMEM you can choose
    between them using the -nm_version option. The installations must be
    specified in the psn.conf file.

    -nmfe
    New feature in PsN3.  Invoke nmfe6 or nmfe7 (not nmfe5) from within PsN 
    instead of doing stepwise compiling and execution. PsN will look for nmfeX, 
    where X is the NONMEM version number specified in psn.conf,  
    in first the /util then the /run and last the /. subdirectory of the 
    NONMEM installation directory specified in psn.conf, and call 
    the first instance found. The compiler settings in psn.conf are not needed. 
    On some computer architechtures it  may still be necessary to perform stepwise 
    compiling and execution, i.e. nmfe cannot be used.
    Option prepend_model_to_lst should not be used with nmfe option, then
    the model would be prepended both by PsN and by nmfe.

    -nmfe_options='options for nmfe'
    Only relevant if option -nmfe or -run_on_sge_nmfe or -nmqual is set 
    and NONMEM7.2 or later is used.
    A comma-separated list of options that will be passed on to nmfe.
    The options must be given without the - (PsN will add them), i.e.
    PsN option -nmfe_options=prsame,xmloff will append
    -prsame -xmloff
    to the nmfe call.
    PsN will not check that the options are appropriate given existing 
    compiled files and properties of the model and data, nor check that
    the option is one that will be recognized by nmfe.
    It is possible to set -nmfe_options=licfile=somenewlicfile.lic but 
    then the user must also set -extra_files=somenewlicfile.lic. Same for nmexec. 

    -nmqual
    New feature in PsN-3.1.2. Invoke an NMQual generated perl script  
    from within PsN instead of doing stepwise compiling and execution. 
    PsN will look for , 
    where  must include a full path and must be specified in the [nm_versions]
    section of psn.conf. Note that the scriptname itself must also be included in the path in
    psn.conf, not only the directory. The compiler settings in psn.conf are not needed. 
    On some computer architechtures it  may still be necessary to perform stepwise 
    compiling and execution, i.e. nmqual cannot be used.
    Option prepend_model_to_lst should not be used with nmqual option, then
    the model would be prepended twice to the lst-file.

    -nmqual_xml='options for nmqual'
    Only relevant if option -nmqual is set. Default log.xml.
    The name, including path, of the xml file to use in the call to 
    autolog.pl, e.g. as in
    perl autolog.pl log.xml run ce (...)


    -nodes='number'
    Only relevant together with option -parafile. Appends "[nodes]=option_value"
    to the nmfe call. The nodes option is completely independent of the threads 
    option. It is possible to e.g. set threads to 1 and nodes to 10.

      -nonparametric_etas

      No help available for 'nonparametric_etas'

      -nonparametric_marginals

      No help available for 'nonparametric_marginals'

    -omega_before_pk
    For some models, NONMEM requires that $OMEGA is printed before $PK. 
    If you have such a model, this option must be set, otherwise
    PsN will print the records of the modelfile in the wrong order, and the NONMEM runs
    will fail.

    -outputfile='string'
    The -outputfile option specifies the output file name for the
    NONMEM run. Currently this option is only valid when a single
    model is supplied.

    -parafile='filename'
    NONMEM 7.2 (or later) parafile. Appends "-parafile=filename"
    to the nmfe call, and makes PsN copy 'filename' to the NM_run directory.
    Only works if option nmfe/run_on_sge_nmfe/nmqual is set.

    -picky
    The -picky option is only valid together with -tweak_inits. 
    Normally PsN only tries new initial estimates if 
    'MINIMZATION SUCCESSFUL' is not found in the NONMEM output
    file. With the -picky option, PsN will regard any of the
    following messages as a signal for rerunning:

    0ESTIMATE OF THETA IS NEAR THE BOUNDARY
    0PARAMETER ESTIMATE IS NEAR ITS BOUNDARY
    0R MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR
    0S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR

    -precision='integer'
    Precision in sumo output.

    -predict_data='string'
    No help available.

    -predict_model='string'
    No help available.

    -prepend_model_file_name
    Table files by default have generic names, e.g. patab. If multiple
    models are run, files will be overwritten when multiple files
    with the same name are copied back to the same directory.
    This options prevents this by prepending the model file name,
    without extension, thus making the file names unique.

    -prepend_model_to_lst
    This option makes PsN prepend the final lst-file (which is copied 
    back to the directory from which execute was called) with the 
    corresponding modelfile from the set of retries. Since initial estimates 
    are tweaked in the retries, this option makes it easier to see which 
    actual initial estimates gave the best results. PsN can still parse the 
    lst-file with the model prepended, so the file can still be used it as 
    input to e.g. sumo, vpc or update_inits. Option can be disabled with 
    -no-prepend_model_to_lst if it is set in the configuration file psn.conf. 
    Do not use this option together with option nmfe, since then the model
    would be prepended both by PsN and nmfeX.

    -prepend_options_to_lst
    This option makes PsN prepend the final lst-file (which is copied 
    back to the directory from which execute was called) with the 
    file version_and_option_info.txt which contains run information, including
    all actual values of optional PsN options. PsN can still parse the  
    lst-file with the options prepended, so the file can still be used it as 
    input to e.g. sumo, vpc or update_inits. Option can be disabled with 
    -no-prepend_options_to_lst if it is set in psn.conf. 

    -quick_summarize or -quick_summary
    If either of quick_summarize and quick_summary is used, PsN will print 
    the ofv value and minimization message for each NONMEM run.

    -rerun='integer'
    PsN can redo or resume a run using information in PsN run 
    directory(see documentation for -directory). It is called 
    a rerun. During a rerun PsN will consider to redo parts of 
    the run. With the -rerun option you can control which parts 
    will be redone. The default value of -rerun is 1. 
    With rerun set to 1 PsN will rerun any model with a missing 
    list file. Notice that every "retry" (see the documentation 
    for -retries and -min_retries) will be considered for a rerun.
    This means you can change the value of the -retries and 
    -min_retries options if you like more or less retries. 
    Setting -rerun to 0 means that PsN will not check for 
    missing or incomplete "retry" list files. This is useful
    if you have one or more run modelfiles and you wish to have 
    a PsN raw_results file or a PsN summary, you do a  
    run with them as arguments and specify -rerun=0, PsN will not 
    do any NONMEM run, but produce useful output summary. 
    You can also set -rerun to 2, and PsN will ignore any existing 
    list files and rerun everything, creating raw_results and 
    summaries from the new listfiles.

    -retries='integer'
    The -retries option tells PsN how many times it
    shall try to rerun a NONMEM job if it fails according to given criterias. In
    the current version of PsN (2.2), the -retries option is only
    valid together with -tweak_inits. The default value of the
    -retries option is 0.

    -run_on_lsf
    PsN connects with Platform Load Sharing Facility (LsF). With 
    -run_on_lsf. PsN will submit to the queue defined in "psn.conf" 
    unless specified with -lsf_queue.

    -run_on_lsf
    PsN connects with Platform Load Sharing Facility (LsF).
    Unlike when run_on_lsf is set, with this option PsN will submit nmfe directly with bsub,
    instead of calling nonmem.pm.

    -run_on_mosix
    Only implemented and tested for Unix type systems. PsN will start the perl 
    processes running NONMEM with 'mosenv -e perl...' instead of the default 'perl...'.
    (The name of the perl binary is configurable in psn.conf.)

    -run_on_sge
    Use Sun Grid Engine queueing system.

    -run_on_sge_nmfe
    Default not used. A slimmed down alternative to setting -run_on_sge and 
    -nmfe in combination. With this option set, the qsub command will be on 
    nmfe directly, instead of on 'perl nonmem.pm' which in turns calls nmfe. 
    This removes much overhead (no perl process submitted with qsub) at the 
    cost of some of PsN:s error handling implemented in the nonmem.pm module. 
    Setting this option bypasses nonmem.pm completely. The options -sge_queue, 
    -sge_resource and -sge_prepend_flags work the same way as with run_on_sge.

      -run_on_slurm

      No help available for 'run_on_slurm'

    -run_on_torque
    Use Torque batch queueing system.

    -run_on_ud
    PsN connects with United Devices Grid MP. With -run_on_ud PsN will submit to the UD grid
    with parameters defined in the "uduserconf" file.

    -run_on_zink
    Experimental clustering on Windows machine.

    -sde
    If you are running SDE models, you must use this option, otherwise
    PsN will print the records of the modelfile in the wrong order, and the NONMEM runs
    will fail.

    -seed='string'
    You can set your own random seed to make PsN runs reproducible.
    The random seed will be used with the -retries option 
    and with e.g. the bootstrap, vpc, npc and nonpb scripts. 

    -send_email
    Only valid with -run_on_slurm and -email_address in combination, otherwise ignored.
    Determines if sbatch options --mail_type=ALL --mail_user= should be set.

    -sge_prepend_flags='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_sge or -run_on_sge_nmfe. The - signs must be included in the 
    string. The extra flags will be prepended to standard set in qsub call.


    -sge_queue='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_sge or -run_on_sge_nmfe. Maps to qsub option -q

    -sge_resource='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_sge or -run_on_sge_nmfe. Maps to qsub option -l

    -shrinkage
    Calculate the shrinkage for the model run.  Shrinkage is
    calculated as 1-(sd(eta(x))/omega(x)) and measures the shrinkage of the
    empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) towards the mean of the expected
    distribution.  A 'large' shrinkage means that diagnostics using EBEs cannot
    be trusted.

    -sign_digits_off_diagonals='integer'
    The off-diagonal elements are checked against +-1 with this many
    significant digits. Valid only in sumo.

    -significant_digits_accept='number'
    The -significant_digits_accept option is only valid together with -tweak_inits. 
    Normally PsN tries new initial estimates if 
    'MINIMZATION SUCCESSFUL' is not found in the NONMEM output
    file. With the -significant_digits_accept, PsN will only rerun if 
    the resulting significant digits is lower than the value 
    specified with this option.

    -silent
    The silent option turns off all output from PsN. Results and log
    files are still written to disk, but nothing is printed to the
    screen.

      -skip_data_parsing

      No help available for 'skip_data_parsing'

    -slurm_prepend_flags='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_slurm. The - signs must be included in the 
    string. The extra flags will be prepended to standard set in sbatch call.


    -slurm_project='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_slurm, then required. Maps to sbatch -A option.


      -stop_motion

      No help available for 'stop_motion'

    -tail_output
    This option only works for execute under Windows.
    tail_output specifies that execute
    should invoke a program (tail) that displays the output file,
    including the gradients, during minmization. The tail program is started
    automatically but it is up to the user to terminate the program.

    For the tail_output option to work, a third party
    tail program must be installed. Tail programs that are known to work
    are WinTail and Tail for Win32.  The latter is recommended and can
    be downloaded at http://tailforwin32.sourceforge.net. It
    is also necessary to have correct settings of the variables 
    wintail_exe, which is the path to the tail program, and wintail_command,
    which is the command for the tail program. 
    An example, which works for the Tail for Win32 package, is
    wintail_exe = 'C:\Program Files\Tail-4.2.12\Tail.exe'
    and
    wintail_command = 'tail OUTPUT'
    These two variables must be set in psn.conf, or given on the command-line,
    using the form shown here, including quotation marks.

    -tbs
    Default not set. Invokes Transform Both Sides method. Model must be coded
    'the Uppsala way', i.e. with IWRES and W and SIGMA 1 FIX.
    See the userguide common_options_defaults_versions_psn for details.

    -threads='integer'
    Use the threads option to enable parallel execution of multiple
    NONMEM runs. On a desktop computer it is recommended to set
    -threads to the number of CPUs in the system plus one. You can
    specify more threads, but it will probably not increase the
    performance. If you are running on a computer cluster, you should
    consult your system administrator to find out how many threads
    you can specify. The -threads option will be ignored if you run on
    a grid system, since grids have their own scheduling algoritms. The
    default value for the -threads option is 1.

    -torque_prepend_flags='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_torque. The - signs must be included in the 
    string. The extra flags will be prepended to standard set in qsub call.


    -torque_queue='string'
    Only valid with -run_on_torque. Maps to qsub option -q

    -tweak_inits
    If NONMEM terminates nonsuccessfully, PsN can perturb the initial
    estimates and run NONMEM again. The generation of new initial
    estimates init_i for the i:th retry are performed according to

    init_i = init_0 + rand_uniform(+-0.1*i*init_0)

    where init_0 are the initial estimates of the original run. The
    updating procedure makes sure that boundary conditions on the
    parameters are still valid. For this option to have effect, the
    -retries option must be set to number larger than zero. The
    default setting uses tweak_inits.
    

    -unwrap_table_files
    Ensures that all table rows are on a single line in the table file.

    -verbose
    With verbose set to 1, PsN will print
    more details about NONMEM runs. More precisely PsN will print the
    minimization message for each successfull run and a R:X for each
    retry PsN makes of a failed run, where X is the run number.

    -version
    Print PsN version of script called.

    -warn_with_trace='integer'
    If the -debug level is bigger than zero PsN will print warning 
    messages. If -warn_with_trace is set, PsN will print a stack 
    trace from the point where the warning message was printed. 
    This is only for developers.

    -wintail_command='string'
    Only for Windows. See execute -h tail_output for description.

    -wintail_exe='string'
    Only for Windows. See execute -h tail_output for description.

    -wrap_data
    NONMEM only allows 20 column datasets, but it is possible to wrap
    observation lines into multiple rows by adding a CONT column. With
    wrap_data PsN does it automatically.
