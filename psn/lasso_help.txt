  lasso

    LASSO method for covariate model selection.






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -thr, but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -convergence

    The convergence criterion.
    'REACHMAX' Stop when program reaches max (stop_t), then best t-value is selected.
    'FIRSTMIN' Stop when predicted ofv increases from previous value (or when stop_t is reached)
    'HALT' Stop when program crashes or when one model cannot terminate.
    The best value until this point is selected

      -cutoff=X

    The theta cutoff.

      -groups=N

    The number of validation groups.

      -lst_file=filename

    Name of lst-file for input model if other than same name with lst-extension.

      -pred_ofv_start_t=X

    Total predicted ofv of model at t=start_t.

      -relations

    The parameter-covariate pairs to test and the parameterizations to use.
    The parameterizations are: 1)linear assuming categorical covariate, 
    2)linear assuming continuous covariate, 
    3)piece-wise linear (hockey-stick)

    The syntax is sensitive and must follow this form.
    Note colons, commas. There must be no spaces in the list of relations.
    There are double commas before a new parameter.
    It is optional to input the breakpoint for the piece-wise linear 
    relation (3), the number is then set after a second dash (-)
    as in WGT-3-45.2

    -relations=CL:WGT-2,SEX-1,RACE-1,,V:WGT-3-45.2,,KA:WGT-3,APGR-2


      -start_t=X

    The t-value to start at.

      -step_t=X

    The steplength for LASSO. The steplength can be negative.

      -stop_t=X

    The t-value to end at.

      -stratify_on=variable

    PsN will try to preserve the relative proportions of individuals
    with different values of the stratification variable
    when creating data subsets during crossvalidation.
    The stratification variable must be found in the original dataset.

    Also see 'psn_options -h' for a description of common PsN options.
