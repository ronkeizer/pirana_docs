    Numerical Predictive Check.






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -censor=VARIABLE

      Name of variable which defines whether the observation of the dependent variable
      is missing, e.g. due to drop-out. 1 means the observation is censored, 
      0 means the observation is not censored.
      The variable must be requestable in $TABLE.

      -confidence_interval=number

      An integer between 1 and 99 specifying the confidence interval in percent.
      Default is 95.

      -covariance_file=filename

      For simulating with uncertainty.
      Instead of using identical parameter estimates for simulation of each
      new dataset, sample sets of parameter estimates based on the
      variance-covariance matrix, assuming that the corresponding means
      are the initial estimates in the input model
      (after updating if a lst-file is available).
      If a separate simulation model, or if option -flip_comments is set,
      the means will be read from that model.
      The covariance file must look exactly like a NM7 .cov file.
      If multiple TABLEs are found in the .cov file, PsN will
      use the last one.

      Since this method requires different parameters for each sample, option 
      n_simulation_models will be automatically set equal to samples.


      -dv=VARIABLE

      Name of dependent variable. Default is DV.
      Case sensitive, must be exactly the same case and spelling as in modelfile.
      Maximum of 4 letters because of NONMEM limitation, unless either IPRED or IWRES.

      -flip_comments

      Method for handling user-defined simulation code in the model. If this option is set,
      PsN will create the simulation model by flipping comments (commented lines will be
      uncommented and vice versa) between the tags 
      ;Sim_start 
      and 
      ;Sim_end
      Note that the
      tags must look exactly like that or the editing will fail. After creating
      the simulation model PsN will remove $COV and $TABLE, change SEED, NSUBS 
      and MAXEVAL in $SIM, and add a new $TABLE, but otherwise no changes will be made.

      -keep_estimation
      
      Perform post-hoc evalutaion step for each simulated dataset,
      i.e. keep the $ESTIMATION record and set MAXEVALS to 0. In this case
      variables such as IPRED(F) are based on the re-estimated post-hoc 
      parameters.      

      -lst_file=file

      The npc will update initial parameter estimates in the model to
      the final values in the lst-file. Optional parameter.
      Cannot be used together with -msfo_file option nor with a model
      containing a $NONPARAMETRIC record.

      -msfo_file=file

      The npc will use the NONMEM state defined in the update file.
      Cannot be used together with -lst_file option.
      If the modelfile contains a $NONPARAMETRIC record this parameter
      is required, otherwise it is optional.

      -n_simulation_models=N

      Default 1, which means all simulations are run in the same modelfile.
      By setting this option to a number N greater than 1, the 'samples' simulations
      will be split equally between N model files, which can be run in parallel.
      This option cannot be used together with option -sim_table or, if 
      the NONMEM version < 7, together with -dv=CWRES.

      -no_of_strata=number

      Only allowed together with -stratify_on.
      An integer requesting the number of strata.
      The number must be equal to or less than the number of unique 
      values in the stratification column.
      If the number is smaller than the number of unique values, the 
      observations will be grouped so that the number of observations in
      each group/strata is approximately equal.

      -noprediction
      
      Add NOPREDICTION to the $SIMULATION record of the simulation model
      in addition to ONLYSIMULATION. This option is generally recommended
      with likelihood models for odd type data.

      -offset_rawres=N

      Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. Default 1.
      The number of result lines to skip in the input raw results file
      before starting to read final parameter estimates. In a regular
      bootstrap raw_results file the first line of estimates refers to the
      input model with the full dataset, so therefore the default offset is 1.

      -orig_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with original data,
      instead of letting the program create it.
      This option can only be used together with -sim_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -rawres_input=filename

      A simple way to simulate with uncertainty.
      Instead of using identical parameter estimates for simulation of each
      new dataset, take parameter estimates from a raw_results.csv file,
      e.g. from a bootstrap run. The raw results file must contain
      at least as many samples as the input -samples to npc plus the 
      value of option -offset_rawres, the labels
      for THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA in the file must match the labels in the
      simulation model given as input to sse, and the first column must have
      header model as a bootstrap raw_results file.

      Since this method requires different parameters for each sample, option 
      n_simulation_models will be automatically set equal to samples.



      -samples=number

      Number of simulated datasets to generate, required.
      Must be at least 20.

      -sim_model=file

      Use a separate input model for the simulations. PsN will remove 
      $COV and $TABLE, change SEED, NSUBS and MAXEVAL in $SIM, and add a new $TABLE, but
      otherwise no changes will be made to the user defined simulation model.

      -sim_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with simulated data,
      instead of letting the program run the simulations.
      This option can only be used together with -orig_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -stratify_on=COLUMN_HEADER

      Header of column to stratify on.
      The npc will stratify the data on unique values in the specified
      column, and perform separate analyses on each set. Stratification 
      may also be done on a user-defined parameter which must be called STRT.
