    Perl speaks NONMEM.

    Listing of PsN scripts.






      bootstrap - Bootstrap using the percentile or BCa method.

      cdd - Case Deletion Diagnostics

      create_cont_data - wrap the rows in a dataset with
      more than 20 columns.

      create_extra_data_model - create a model file with more 
      than one data file per problem.

      create_subsets -  creates subsets of the individuals of
      a dataset.

      data_stats - Print simple statistics for dataset columns.

      execute - NONMEM runs are started using one or multiple model files.

      extended_grid - non-parametric estimation on the extended grid.

      llp - Log-Likelihood Profiling around maximum-likelihood parameter
      estimates.

      mcmp - Monte-Carlo mapped power. A fast method for power computations.

      -nm_versions is an option to this program psn, not a standalone script. 
      The command 
      psn -nm_versions 
      will give a list of the available NONMEM versions defined in the 
      configuration file psn.conf, i.e. the available alternatives for
      common option -nm_version (see psn_options -h nm_version for details).

      nonpb - Non-Parametric Bootstrap

      npc - Numerical Predictive Check

      pind - Individual Probabilities

      psn_options - List options common to most PsN scripts.

      runrecord - Create records of NONMEM runs

      scm - Stepwise Covariate Model-building

      se_of_eta - Standard Errors of Etas

      single_valued_columns - Identifies dataset columns with 
      values that do not vary within an individual. This is 
      useful for creation of extra data files when the number 
      of columns needed are above 20.

      sse - Stochastic Simulation and Estimation

      sumo - Summary of Output from NONMEM

      unwrap_data - unwraps a data file coded with
      the CONT data item for split rows. 

      update_inits - read final THETA, OMEGA and SIGMA estimates from a 
      NONMEM output file and put into a given model file.

      vpc - Visual Predictive Check


    Use 'psn -h "scriptname"' for a one-line description of a script,
    for example 'psn -h sse'.

    Use '"scriptname" -help' for details on a particular script,
    for example 'sse -help'. Exception is -nm_versions which is only
    an option to this program, see 'psn -h nm_versions'.

    Use 'psn_options -h' for a list of common options to PsN.
