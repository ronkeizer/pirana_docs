    Visual Predictive Check.






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -bin_array=x1,x2,...
      
      A comma-separated list of either the number of observations in each
      bin or the boundaries between bins, depending on whether the option 
      -bin_by_count is 1 or 0. If binning is done by count, the list 
      must contain at least 2 numbers, otherwise 1 number is enough.
      If used, the option -bin_by_count is required, while all other
      binning options are forbidden.

      -bin_by_count= 1 | 0

      Decide whether binning should be done based on the number of 
      observations (1) in each bin or the width of the binning interval (0).
      Required unless only the independent variable is specified without any
      binning options, then forbidden.

      -boxcox_lambda=Y

      Setting this variable indicates that data is Box-Cox transformed. 
      Data will be transformed to normal scale for eventual prediction correction,
      and retransformed to Box-Cox before analysis and output.
      Option cannot be used with lnDV.

      -censor=VARIABLE

      Name of variable which defines whether DV or similar is missing, e.g. due to drop-out.
      1 means the observation is censored, 0 means the observation is not censored.
      The variable must be requestable in $TABLE.

      -confidence_interval=number

      An integer between 1 and 99 specifying the confidence interval in percent.

      -dv=VARIABLE

      Name of dependent variable. Default is DV.
      Case sensitive, must be exactly the same case and spelling as in modelfile.
      Maximum of 4 letters because of NONMEM limitation, unless either IPRED or IWRES.

      -flip_comments

      Method for handling user-defined simulation code in the model. If this option is set,
      PsN will create the simulation model by flipping comments (commented lines will be
      uncommented and vice versa) between the tags 
      ;Sim_start 
      and 
      ;Sim_end
      Note that the
      tags must look exactly like that or the editing will fail. After creating
      the simulation model PsN will remove $COV and $TABLE, change SEED, NSUBS 
      and MAXEVAL in $SIM, and add a new $TABLE, but otherwise no changes will be made.

      -idv=VARIABLE

      Name of independent variable, optional, default TIME.
      The vpc will bin the observations based on the independent 
      variable, either on unique values of the specified variable 
      (default), or according to selected binning options.

      -keep_estimation
      
      Perform post-hoc evalutaion step for each simulated dataset,
      i.e. keep the $ESTIMATION record and set MAXEVALS to 0. In this case
      variables such as IPRED(F) are based on the re-estimated post-hoc 
      parameters.      

      -levels=level1,level2,...
      
      A comma-separated list of the boundaries for a categorization.
      First category <= level1 < second category <= level2 etc.

      -lloq=number
      
      Lower Limit Of Quantification for left censored data.

      -lnDV=0, 1 or 2
      
      lnDV=0 is the default. PsN will not exponentiate DV values. If option -predcorr is used,
             PsN will assume that values are on the normal scale.
      lnDV=1 PsN exponentiates all DV values (and PRED values if these are needed)
             before analysis (but after prediction/variability correction).
      lnDV=2 is only allowed together with option -predcorr. PsN will assume DV and PRED are 
             log-transformed but will not exponentiate.
      lnDV=3 PsN log transforms all DV values (and PRED values if these are needed)
             before analysis (and before prediction/variability correction).

      -lower_bound=number or variable
      
      Only allowed together with option -predcorr, and when lnDV= 0 or 1. Value can be either
      a number or an independent variable present in $INPUT or defined in the modelfile.

      -lst_file=file

      The vpc will update initial parameter estimates in the model to
      the final values in the lst file. Optional parameter.
      Cannot be used together with -msfo_file option nor with a model
      containing a $NONPARAMETRIC record.

      -mirrors=N

      Generate output data for N mirror plots.

      -msfo_file=file

      The vpc will use the NONMEM state defined in the update file.
      Cannot be used together with -lst_file option.
      If the modelfile contains a $NONPARAMETRIC record this parameter
      is required, otherwise it is optional.

      -n_simulation_models=N

      Default 1, which means all simulations are run in the same modelfile.
      By setting this option to a number N greater than 1, the 'samples' simulations
      will be split equally between N model files, which can be run in parallel.
      This option cannot be used together with option -sim_table or, if 
      the NONMEM version < 7, together with -dv=CWRES.

      -no_of_bins=N

      Number of bins of approximately equal size to create. Optional.
      The number must be larger than 1.
      If used, the option -bin_by_count is required, while all other
      binning options are forbidden.

      -no_of_strata=number

      Only allowed together with -stratify_on.
      An integer requesting the number of strata.
      The number must be equal to or less than the number of unique 
      values of the stratification variable.
      If the number is smaller than the number of unique values, the 
      observations will be grouped so that the number of observations in
      each group/strata is approximately equal.

      -noprediction
      
      Add NOPREDICTION to the $SIMULATION record of the simulation model
      in addition to ONLYSIMULATION. This option is generally recommended
      with likelihood models for odd type data.

      -offset_rawres=N

      Only relevant in combination with rawres_input. Default 1.
      The number of result lines to skip in the input raw results file
      before starting to read final parameter estimates. In a regular
      bootstrap raw_results file the first line of estimates refers to the
      input model with the full dataset, so therefore the default offset is 1.

      -orig_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with original data,
      instead of letting the program create it.
      This option can only be used together with -sim_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -overlap_percent=Y

      An integer specifying the percent overlap between consecutive bins. 
      If used, the options -bin_by_count and -single_bin_size are required,
      while all other binning options are forbidden.

      -predcorr
      
      Perform prediction correction on dependent variable values before computing vpc results.
      If option -varcorr is used simultaneously, prediction correction is performed first.

      -rawres_input=filename

      A simple way to simulate with uncertainty.
      Instead of using identical parameter estimates for simulation of each
      new dataset, take parameter estimates from a raw_results.csv file,
      e.g. from a bootstrap run. The raw results file must contain
      at least as many samples as the input -samples to vpc plus the 
      value of option -offset_rawres, the labels
      for THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA in the file must match the labels in the
      simulation model given as input to sse, and the first column must have
      header model as a bootstrap raw_results file.

      Since this method requires different parameters for each sample, option 
      n_simulation_models will be automatically set equal to samples.


      -samples=number

      Number of simulated datasets to generate, required.
      Must be at least 20.

      -sim_model=file

      Use a separate input model for the simulations. PsN will remove 
      $COV and $TABLE, change SEED, NSUBS and MAXEVAL in $SIM, and add a new $TABLE, but
      otherwise no changes will be made to the user defined simulation model.

      -sim_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with simulated data,
      instead of letting the program run the simulations.
      This option can only be used together with -orig_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -single_bin_size=X

      An scalar specifying the size of individual bins. The number 
      either specifies the number of observations in each bin or 
      the width of the binning interval, depending on whether the 
      option -bin_by_count is 1 or 0. If used, the option 
      -bin_by_count is required and -overlap_percent is optional,
      while all other binning options are forbidden.

      -stratify_on=VARIABLE

      Variable to stratify on. The variable must be independent, i.e. be
      the same for all simulations of a particular observation.
      The vpc will stratify the data on unique values of the specified
      variable, and perform separate analyses on each set. Stratification 
      may also be done on a user-defined parameter which must be called STRT.

      -tte=VARIABLE

      Assume a time-to-event type model. PsN will add the tte-variable to $TABLE
      of the simulation model (not the original data model), and format the output
      differently compared to a regular vpc. The value in the tte-columns should
      be equal to 0 if there was not an event, and non-zero otherwise. 
      Check npc_vpc_userguide.pdf for details.

      -uloq=number
      
      Upper Limit Of Quantification for right censored data.

      -varcorr
      
      Perform variability correction on dependent variable values before computing vpc results.
      If option -predcorr is used simultaneously, prediction correction is performed first.
