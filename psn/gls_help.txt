    Generalised Least Squares approximation of FOCE INTER






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -thr, but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -additive_theta=XX

      Default not used. In gls model, add a small and fix additive error in W. 
      The error is added by changing W=SQRT() to 
      W=SQRT(THETA(T)**2+) in the gls model, where T is the order 
      number of new $THETA XX FIX added to the model.

      -gls_model

      Default not set. Only possible together with option -iwres_shrinkage 
      or -ind-shrinkage. This option is to be used when a datafile with all data 
      needed for the gls model run is already available, i.e. all input for the 
      original model plus columns with PRED and IPRED from the original model run 
      with METHOD=1 NOINTER, and if -ind_shrinkage is set also a ISHR column with 
      per observation shrinkage values. The option indicates that $DATA specifies 
      the file with the gls input data, and that $INPUT lists the parameters in the 
      datafile. In $INPUT the columns PPRE and PIPR must be present, plus ISHR 
      if -ind_shrinkage is set, as headers for PRED and IPRED values, and possibly 
      shrinkage, from the original model run.
      Then PsN will add the GLSP code to the gls model and run it directly, saving 
      the original model run.

      Note that a run with the ebe_npde program will automatically generate
      a complete input file for gls (including PRED IPRED and per-observation shrinkage)

      -ind_shrinkage

      Default not set. Compute per-observation iwres-shrinkage based on simulations. 

      -iwres_shrinkage=X

      Default not used. Forbidden in combination with -ind_shrinkage. If the 
      population iwres shrinkage from the input model run with METHOD=1 NOINTER 
      is already available, the user can give the value as input to save some 
      computing time. The saving is however negligible unless option -gls_model 
      is also used, see below. Important note: PsN reports shrinkage in percent 
      in the raw_results file, so when input using the iwres_shrinkage option the 
      value from raw_results must be divided by 100.

      -reminimize

      Default not set. Only relevant if -ind_shrinkage is set and -gls_model is 
      not set.By default, simulated datasets will be run with MAXEVAL=0 
      (or equivalent for non-classical estimation methods). If option -reminimize 
      is set then $EST will be the same as in the input model.

      -samples=N

      Default not used. Only relevant if -ind_shrinkage is set and -gls_model 
      is not set. Creates N copies of input model with different seeds in $SIM. 
      Run to get N IWRES values for each data point yij. Compute 
      iwres_shrinkageij =1-stdev(IWRESij(1:N))
