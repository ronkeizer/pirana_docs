    Stepwise covariate model building from NONMEM models.
        




    The Cross-validated Stepwise Covariate Model (XV_SCM) building tool 
    of PsN implements cross-validated model size selection for a
    covariate model. It relies on the SCM tool of PsN.
        
    A configuration file must be written for each xv_scm run. The 
    format of the configuration file follows the format of the scm
    configuration file exactly, except that options 
    search_direction, gof, p_value, p_forward, p_backward and 
    update_derivatives are ignored.
    


    Execute an XV_SCM using parameters set in the config file
    'phenobarbital.scm'.

    xv_scm -config_file=phenobarbital.scm

    Execute an XV_SCM using parameters set in the config file
    'phenobarbital.scm'. But override the retries and the seed
    parameter.


    xv_scm -config_file=phenobarbital.scm -retries=5 -seed=12345 phenobarbital.mod



    The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
    abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option may
    be abbreviated to -thr but -debug may not be abbreviated to -d 
    because it conflicts with -debug_packages and -debug_subroutines.

    The following options are valid:


    -config_file

    A path and file name to an scm configuration file.

    -do_not_drop

    Since the number of columns are restricted to 20 for NONMEM it is
    necessary to minimize the number of undropped columns. The xv_scm
    utility uses the '=DROP' syntax of NONMEM to exclude the covariate
    columns that are not used. If some covariates are used in the PK
    or PRED code in the basic model you must list them using the
    do_not_drop option to prevent them from being dropped.

    -epsilon

    Only relevant with linearize method. Linearize with respect to epsilons,
    set by default. Disable with -no-epsilon.

    -foce

    Only relevant with linearize method. Expand around conditional ETA estimates 
    instead of around ETA=0. The default is around conditional ETAs.
    

    -global_init

      -groups=N

    The number of validation groups. Default 5.

    -linearize

    Invoke covariates using taylor expansions (linearize) method.
    

    -logfile

    The name of the logfile.

    -lst_file

    Name of file with initial estimates for linearize method.
    

      -max_steps=N

    Do not take more that max_steps forward steps,
    even if there are more covariates left to add and a significant
    inclusion was made in the last step.

    -model

    The name of the basic model file, without any parameter-covariate
    relations included.

    -only_successful

    Only consider runs with MINIMIZATION SUCCESSFUL 
    (or equivalent for non-classical estimation methods) when 
    selecting the covariate to add/remove in each step.

    -parallel_states

    If this option is set, xv_scm will test all valid_states simultaneously
    instead of the default method to test valid_states sequentially, only
    testing a higher state if the preceeding state has been included in the model.

      -splits=N

    The number times to perform a complete cross-validation
    with a new data split. Default 1.

      -stratify_on=variable

    PsN will try to preserve the relative proportions of individuals
    with different values of the stratification variable
    when creating data subsets during cross-validation.
    The stratification variable must be found in the original dataset,
    and there must be at least 'groups' individuals having each
    unique value of the stratification variable. If the stratification
    variable is continuous it is recommended to first group the values
    and then stratify on group number instead of the continuous variable.

    Also see 'scm -h' for a list of scm options,
    and 'psn_options -h' for a description of common options.
