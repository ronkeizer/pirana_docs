update_inits
    Update NONMEM modelfile initial estimates of theta, omega and sigma
    using final estimates from lst-file or initial estimates from other modelfile.
    Only works when single problem in modelfile.

Example: (modify file old.mod and copy original to old.mod.org):    
    update_inits old.mod old.lst

OR (create new file new.mod):
    update_inits old.mod old_output.lst -output_model=new.mod

OR (assume there exists an lst-file with name myModel.lst ):
    update_inits myModel.mod -output_model=new.mod

OR (copy estimates from modelfile instead of lst-file, modify old.mod):
    update_inits old.mod -from_model=other.mod -extra_records=PK,DATA

Required input: The name of a modelfile.

Optional input: 
<lst-filename>              The name of the lst-file to read final estimates from.
                            Cannot be used together with option -from_model.

-from_model=<filename>      The name of the modelfile to copy records from. 
                            Cannot be used together with lst-file input.

-output_model=<filename>    The name of the modelfile to create. If omitted, a copy of
                            the original modelfile with extension .org is created, and 
                            the original file is modified.

-extra_records=rec1,rec2    A comma-separated list of record names without $. Additional
                            records to replace, e.g. DATA.

-ignore_missing_parameters  Do not require 1-1 matching of parameter names and indexes.

-sigdig=N                   Only has effect with NONMEM7 and later and if N<15. Print parameter
                            estimates with this many significant digits in the new model file.

-renumber=<new number>      All words in $TABLE records that end with tab<any number> 
                            will get <any number> replaced by <new number>, provided 
			    that <new number> is not 0.
			    If <filename> in MSFO=<filename> in the  $ESTIMATION record
			    ends with a number, that number will be replaced by <new number>.
			    MSFO may not be abbreviated.
			    If the input modelfile name is runX.mod and -output_model is runY.mod
			    where both X and Y are numbers then -renumber=Y will be set automatically.
			    Set option -renumber=0 to prevent renumbering in such a case.

-comment=<comment>          If the option is used, a new line with <comment> will be inserted 
                            directly following the $PROBLEM row.
			    The comment must be enclosed with quotes if it contains spaces.

-add_tags                   Add all runrecord tags. update_inits will not check if any tags 
                            are already present.

-degree=X                   After updating the initial estimates in the output file, randomly
                            perturb them by degree=X, i.e. change estimate to a value
			    randomly chosen in the range estimate +/- estimate*X while
			    respecting upper and lower boundaries, if set.
			    Degree is set to 0.1 when tweak_inits is set in execute.

-based_on=<run_number>      If the Based on tag is present in the modelfile, or if option 
                            -add_tags is used, update_inits will by default try to extract 
			    a run number from the original modelfile name and set the 
			    Based on tag for runrecord to that number. If a number cannot 
			    be extracted then nothing will be set. If the -based_on option 
			    is used, update_inits will set the tag to that number.

-add_prior=df               Add $PRIOR NWPRI based on output object. Will automatically read
                            estimates and covariances from output and use them to define the 
			    prior. df should be the degrees of freedom, a comma-separated list
			    with one integer per omega block.
			    This feature is highly experimental, and you must check $PRIOR 
			    in the new model file manually before using it.
			    Option -add_prior cannot be used together with option -from_model.
