# Automated modeling workflow

## Background

Development of population PK models is an important step
in drug development programs. However, the process of PK model
development for candidate drugs is laborious and repetitive when done
manually, and the untimely completion of PopPK analyses might impede
the impact it can have in drug development. Additionally,
between-modeler variability in model development techniques renders
model development difficult to standardize between drugs. An automated
workflow, such as presented e.g. by Schmidt H et al. (JPKPD 2014),
would alleviate the burden on modeling scientist by removing the
repetitive task of running and evaluating many candidate models, would
standardize the model development between modelers, and standardize
the results reported from such an analysis. Astellas is seeking such
an automated model evaluation workflow, and requested Pirana Software
to present a proposal for implementation within the Pirana software
currently used by Astellas.
